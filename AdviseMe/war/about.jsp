		<b>AdviseMe</b> was created in the hopes of making registration for students at The University of Texas at Austin less stressful. 
		Most of the time, class descriptions are vague and students aren't aware of what they're getting into. Often times, students 
		will take multiple time-consuming classes together, buy books they never end up using, or get catch unawares on the type of 
		material being taught in a certain course. <b>AdviseMe</b> is here to resolve all those problems and make it easier to plan out 
		their schedules.
